<h3>Hi there 👋</h3>
I'm Jared, a Support Engineer and tech enthusiast. I have over 16 years of tech-related experience which includes building computers, creating websites, designing web layouts, building apps and trying out new things. On the non tech side, I eat lots of 🍝 and take care of my two 🐕.
